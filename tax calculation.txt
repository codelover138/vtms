2.	Advance Payments (Acconti): Prepaid taxes for the current year, based on the taxable income of the previous year.

Example: Year-by-Year Explanation
Here’s an example to show how it works, including adjustments in the third year:
Year 1 (First Year) 2025
•	Total Sales: €40,000
•	INPS Amount= get from inps calculation
•	Coefficient of Profitability: 78%
•	Taxable Income: €37,000 × 0.78 = €28,860
•	Tax Rate: 5% (for first 5 years in Regime Forfettario)
•	Tax Due (Year 1): €28,860 × 0.05 = €1,443
•	Total Income= Total Income – Previous year paid INPS amount
Payment Schedule in Year 1:
No payments are made because no prior year income exists for calculating advances.
________________________________________
Year 2 (Second Year) 2026
In Year 2, you pay the balance for Year 1 and advances for Year 2.
•	Balance Payment for Year 1: €1,443
•	Advance Payments for Year 2: Based on 80% of Year 1 tax (€1,154.4):
o	First Advance (50%): €1,443 × 0.50 = € 577.2(due June 30).
o	Second Advance (50%): €1,443 × 0.50 = €577.2 (due November 30).
Total Payments in Year 2:
•	Balance: €1,443
•	Advance Payments: €577.2 + €577.2 = €1,154.4
Total Paid in Year 2: €2,597.4
________________________________________
Year 3 (Third Year): 2027
In Year 3, you calculate the actual tax based on Year 2's income and adjust the advance payments for Year 3 accordingly.
Case 1: If Year 2 Income Increases
•	Year 2 Total Sales: €50,000
•	Previous Year INPS= get from inps calculation
•	Taxable Income: €46,000 × 0.78 = €35,880
•	Tax Due (Year 2): €35,800 × 0.05 = €1,794
Adjustments in Year 3:
•	Balance for Year 2: €1,794 − €1,154.4 (advances already paid) = €639.6 (paid by June 30).
•	Advances for Year 3: Based on 80% of Year 2 tax (€1,435.2):
o	First Advance (50%): €1,435.2 × 0.50 = €717.6 (due June 30).
o	Second Advance (50%): €1,435.2 × 0.50 = €717.6 (due November 30).
Total Payments in Year 3:
•	Balance: €639.6
•	Advance Payments: €717.6 + €717.6= €1,435.2
________________________________________
Case 2: If Year 2 Income Decreases
•	Year 2 Total Sales: €30,000
•	INPS =get from inps calculation
•	Taxable Income: €26,000 × 0.78 = €20,280
•	Tax Due (Year 2): €20,280 × 0.05 = €1,014
Adjustments in Year 3:
•	Balance for Year 2: €1,014 − €1,435.2 (advances already paid) = −€421,2 (overpaid, refunded or credited).
•	Advances for Year 3: Based on 80% of Year 2 tax (€811.2):
o	First Advance (50%): €811.2 × 0.50 = €405.6 (due June 30).
o	Second Advance (50%): €811.2 × 0.50 = €405.6 (due November 30).
Total Payments in Year 3:
•	Balance: −€421.2 (credited or refunded).
•	Advance Payments: €405.6 + €405.6 = €811.2
