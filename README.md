Context
In the Regime Forfettario, income tax (Imposta Sostitutiva) is calculated as a flat rate (e.g., 5% or 15%) on taxable income. Payments are divided into:
1.	Balance Payment (Saldo): The remaining tax due after advance payments for the previous year.
2.	Advance Payments (Acconti): Prepaid taxes for the current year, based on the taxable income of the previous year.

Example: Year-by-Year Explanation
Here’s an example to show how it works, including adjustments in the third year:
Year 1 (First Year) 2025
•	Total Sales: €40,000
•	INPS Amount= get from inps calculation
•	Coefficient of Profitability: 78%
•	Taxable Income: €37,000 × 0.78 = €28,860
•	Tax Rate: 5% (for first 5 years in Regime Forfettario)
•	Tax Due (Year 1): €28,860 × 0.05 = €1,443
•	Total Income= Total Income – Previous year paid INPS amount
Payment Schedule in Year 1:
No payments are made because no prior year income exists for calculating advances.
________________________________________
Year 2 (Second Year) 2026
In Year 2, you pay the balance for Year 1 and advances for Year 2.
•	Balance Payment for Year 1: €1,443
•	Advance Payments for Year 2: Based on 80% of Year 1 tax (€1,154.4):
o	First Advance (50%): €1,443 × 0.50 = € 577.2(due June 30).
o	Second Advance (50%): €1,443 × 0.50 = €577.2 (due November 30).
Total Payments in Year 2:
•	Balance: €1,443
•	Advance Payments: €577.2 + €577.2 = €1,154.4
Total Paid in Year 2: €2,597.4
________________________________________
Year 3 (Third Year): 2027
In Year 3, you calculate the actual tax based on Year 2's income and adjust the advance payments for Year 3 accordingly.
Case 1: If Year 2 Income Increases
•	Year 2 Total Sales: €50,000
•	Previous Year INPS= get from inps calculation
•	Taxable Income: €46,000 × 0.78 = €35,880
•	Tax Due (Year 2): €35,800 × 0.05 = €1,794
Adjustments in Year 3:
•	Balance for Year 2: €1,794 − €1,154.4 (advances already paid) = €639.6 (paid by June 30).
•	Advances for Year 3: Based on 80% of Year 2 tax (€1,435.2):
o	First Advance (50%): €1,435.2 × 0.50 = €717.6 (due June 30).
o	Second Advance (50%): €1,435.2 × 0.50 = €717.6 (due November 30).
Total Payments in Year 3:
•	Balance: €639.6
•	Advance Payments: €717.6 + €717.6= €1,435.2
________________________________________
Case 2: If Year 2 Income Decreases
•	Year 2 Total Sales: €30,000
•	INPS =get from inps calculation
•	Taxable Income: €26,000 × 0.78 = €20,280
•	Tax Due (Year 2): €20,280 × 0.05 = €1,014
Adjustments in Year 3:
•	Balance for Year 2: €1,014 − €1,435.2 (advances already paid) = −€421,2 (overpaid, refunded or credited).
•	Advances for Year 3: Based on 80% of Year 2 tax (€811.2):
o	First Advance (50%): €811.2 × 0.50 = €405.6 (due June 30).
o	Second Advance (50%): €811.2 × 0.50 = €405.6 (due November 30).
Total Payments in Year 3:
•	Balance: −€421.2 (credited or refunded).
•	Advance Payments: €405.6 + €405.6 = €811.2


________________________________________
Process flow the same approach for next of the year
Summary of Payment Adjustment
1.	If income increases: You pay the balance (shortfall) and higher advances for the next year.
2.	If income decreases: You receive a refund or credit for the overpayment, and your advances for the next year are lower.


2. INPS Contributions (Social Security)

•	Payment Frequency:
o	INPS contributions are paid in 4 installments each year.
o	Payment deadlines:
1.	First Installment: May 16.

€50,001 - €100,000	24.5% - 25.0%	Gradual increase
€100,001+	25.0% - 25.5%	Maximum rate
EXAMPLE: €50,000 Annual Income

3.  **Tax Settings Configured**: The customer **MUST** have their tax settings (Customer Type, Tax Regime, Coefficient, etc.) configured. If not, you will be redirected to the settings page to configure them first.

## Navigation

1.  Log in to the **Admin Dashboard**.
2.  Navigate to **Tax Calculations** in the main menu.
3.  Locate the desired customer in the list.
4.  Click the **Actions** button (or the cog icon).
5.  Select **Tax Settings** (`<i class="fa fa-cog"></i>`).
6.  On the Tax Settings page, look at the top header area.
7.  Click the blue button labeled **Add Historical Year** (`<i class="fa fa-history"></i>`).

## Data Entry Form

The "Add Historical Year" form is divided into several sections. Fill in the available data for the selected year.

### 1. General Info
*   **Year**: Select the tax year you are recording. The dropdown shows years from the current year back to 15 years ago.
    *   *Note*: Years that already have data will be marked with "(already has data)".
*   **Coefficient Used**: The profitability coefficient used for that year (e.g., 78.00). Pre-filled from current settings but can be adjusted.
*   **Tax Rate Used**: The tax rate used for that year (e.g., 5.00 or 15.00). Pre-filled from current settings.

### 2. Tax Calculation

## Saving

3.  Upon success, you will be redirected to the **View Tax Calculation** page for that year, where you can verify the saved data.

## Entering Previous Year Data (Crucial for Current Year)

It is highly recommended to enter the **immediately preceding year's data** before calculating the current year's taxes.
*   *Example*: If you are working on the **2026** tax calculation, you should first manually enter the history for **2025**.
*   **Why?**: The system uses the previous year's **Taxable Income** and **Tax Due** to automatically calculate the **Advance Payments (Acconti)** for the current year.

**Steps for Previous Year Entry:**
1.  Follow the [Navigation](#navigation) steps above.
2.  In the **Year** dropdown, select the year immediately before the current one (e.g., if today is 2026, select 2025).
3.  Fill in the **Tax Calculation** fields carefully, especially:
    *   **Tax Due**: This figure determines the advance payments for the following year.
    *   **Next Year Advance Base**: This is often the same as the taxable income or tax due, used as the basis for next year's forecasts.
4.  **Save** the data.
5.  Now, when you go to calculate taxes for the *current* year, the system will accurately project the advance payments based on this historical record.

## Editing Historical Data

To edit previously entered historical data:
1.  Navigate to **Tax Calculations**.
2.  Click **View** for the customer.
3.  Use the year selector to find the historical year.
4.  (Note: If specific edit functionality is restricted, you may need to contact an administrator or update specific payments via the "Update Payment" features in the view).
